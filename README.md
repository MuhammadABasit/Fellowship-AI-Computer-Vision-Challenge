# Answering the question hints for the challenge
1.	Ask yourself why would they have selected this problem for the challenge? What are some gotchas in this domain I should know about?
2.	What is the highest level of accuracy that others have achieved with this dataset or similar problems / datasets ?
3.	What types of visualizations will help me grasp the nature of the problem / data?
4.	What feature engineering might help improve the signal?
5.	Which modeling techniques are good at capturing the types of relationships I see in this data?
6.	Now that I have a model, how can I be sure that I didn't introduce a bug in the code? If results are too good to be true, they probably are!
7.	What are some of the weaknesses of the model and and how can the model be improved with additional work
